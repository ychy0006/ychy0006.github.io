You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
using TMPro;
using UnityEngine.UI;
using UnityEngine;

public class ItemSlotUI : MonoBehaviour
{
    public Image icon;
    public TextMeshProUGUI quatityText;
    private ItemSlot curSlot;
    private Outline outline;

    public int index;
    public bool equipped;

    private void Awake()
    {
        outline = GetComponent<Outline>();
    }

    private void OnEnable()
    {
        outline.enabled = equipped;
    }

    public void Set(ItemSlot slot)
    {
        curSlot = slot;
        icon.gameObject.SetActive(true);
        icon.sprite = slot.item.icon;
        quatityText.text = slot.quantity > 1 ? slot.quantity.ToString() : string.Empty;

        if (outline != null)
        {
            outline.enabled = equipped;
        }
    }

    public void Clear()
    {
        curSlot = null;
        icon.gameObject.SetActive(false);
        quatityText.text = string.Empty;
    }

    public void OnButtonClick()
    {
        Inventory.instance.SelectItem(index);
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}
