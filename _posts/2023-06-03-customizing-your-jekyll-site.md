Jekyll provides several customization options to make your site unique. In this post, we'll explore some of the ways you can customize your Jekyll site.

## Changing the Theme

Jekyll has a wide range of themes available that you can use to change the appearance of your site. To change the theme, update the `theme` setting in the `_config.yml` file to the desired theme name.

## Adding CSS

You can customize the styles of your Jekyll site by adding CSS. Create a new file called `styles.css` in the root directory of your site and link it in the head section of your layout file.

## Customizing Layouts

Jekyll uses layouts to define the structure of your site's pages. You can create your own custom layouts or modify existing ones to match your design requirements. Layout files are stored in the `_layouts` directory.

## Using Plugins

Jekyll supports plugins that extend its functionality. You can find a variety of Jekyll plugins on GitHub that can add features like SEO optimization, sitemaps, and more.

With these customization options, you can create a Jekyll site that reflects your personal style and requirements.
